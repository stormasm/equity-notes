### Notes

why is the 20 year treasury have a higher interest rate than the 30 year treasury

It is abnormal for the 20-year Treasury to have a higher interest rate than the 30-year Treasury. This is a form of yield curve inversion, which reflects unique market forces and investor expectations about future economic conditions.

#### Liquidity and demand

The primary reason for the 20-year anomaly is the specific supply and demand dynamics of that particular bond, which can differ from other maturities.

Weak demand: Since its reintroduction in 2020, the 20-year Treasury has seen weaker demand compared to the more popular 10- and 30-year Treasury bonds.

#### Lower liquidity

As a result of lower demand, the 20-year bond is less liquid and harder to trade. This lack of liquidity makes it less attractive to large, long-term investors like pension funds.

Higher risk premium: To compensate for the low demand and liquidity issues, the 20-year Treasury must offer a higher yield (lower price) to attract buyers. Investors require this extra yield as a risk premium for holding a less popular and less tradeable asset.
